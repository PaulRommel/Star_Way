** Brian Advent inspired me to learn SpriteKit. You can visit his website:  [Here]( https://www.brianadvent.com/)** .
## Description
We all love 2D games for their simplicity and pleasant pastime. It is enough to run this application and you are immersed in the world of space.
## About the project.
### Let's Go.
The project was created in order to get acquainted with the SpriteKit framework. And this goal has been achieved! ;)

## Technologies in the project.
The SpriteKit framework makes it easy to create high-performance, battery-efficient 2D games. With support for custom OpenGL ES shaders and lighting, integration with SceneKit, and advanced new physics effects and animations, you can add force fields, detect collisions, and generate new lighting effects in your games.
